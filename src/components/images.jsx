Stephen immediately springs into action, and notices America Chavez chased by another demon - Gargantos. Both him and his colleague superior - Sorcerer Supreme Wong - are initially unable to hold off Gargantos, but Strange finally kills him with the help of an otherworldy creature.

When asked by Strange to prove all of it, she shows him the corpse of his defender variant, which got sucked up in the portal with her.",
